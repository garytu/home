# apt-fast v0.02 by Matt Parnell http://www.mattparnell.com, this thing is fully open-source
# if you do anything cool with it, let me know so I can publish or host it for you
# contact me at admin@mattparnell.com
# Special thanks to Travis/travisn000 from the PCLinux Forums for making improvements that allow
# for more complex apt-get commands. See the thread: http://www.pclinuxos.com/forum/index.php/topic,66385.0.html
# adicionar suporte aos metalinks no aria2: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1493421
# veja também apt-metalink: http://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/apt-metalink

# apt-metalink allows you to download deb packages from several sources
# concurrently and makes apt-get (dist-)upgrade process faster if you have fast
# internet connection. apt-metalink uses python-apt to interface apt
# infrastructure and aria2 as download back-end. Metalink is used to
# feed package list to aria2.

# neste site você encontra uma versão com suporte a proxy
# http://www.mattparnell.com/linux/apt-fast/apt-fast%20modded/

# este link parece ter algumas novidades sobre o apt-fast
# http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/aria2/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=52

# parece que vai surgir um novo programa chamado apt-metalink
# https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/apt-metalink

# script editado por Sérgio Luiz Araújo Silva
# esta versão do apt-fast usa o aria2 ao invés do axel, fica bem mais rápido
# site: vivaotux.blogspot.com
# download: sudo wget -c http://ur1.ca/02k16 -O /usr/bin/apt-fast && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/apt-fast

## Modified by Alexi "Lord Axraz" Yan to use with aria2c, a more stable downloader. Please install aria2 to use this script.
# Use this just like apt-get for faster package downloading. Make sure to have axel installed.
